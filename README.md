# Chemical and Process Engineering Interactive Simulations

[We](http://cacheme.org) are preparing interactive IPython simulations for chemical and process engineering courses and posting them in this repository. These simulations will allow the user to change equation parameters --using just sliders and buttons-- in order to better understand the behaviour of the system being modeled. Since we will be using [IPython/Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), they can be viewed and modified using [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) (a completely free Python distribution, including for commercial use and redistribution).

## TL;DR
We want to reproduce [this work](http://www.learncheme.com/home) (learnChemE.com) with [this technology](http://www.nature.com/news/ipython-interactive-demo-7.21492) (Nature and IPython)
